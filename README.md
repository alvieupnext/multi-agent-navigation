## Overview
This repository contains two distinct implementations for our project. The aim of this project is to [briefly describe the goal of your project].

## Branches

### Main Branch
- **Description**: The main branch hosts the original implementation of our project using neural network techniques.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Neural Network Framework used: Tensorflow

### Tabular Branch
- **Description**: The tabular branch features our novel implementation utilizing tabular approaches.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Tools/Methods used: Q-Learning and Multi-Armed Bandits

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and make use to install all the depencies required. These can be found in requirements.txt

## Usage
Use run_experiment from main.py with the desired configuration to obtain results. Visualisations can be found on plotting.py and an example on how to query these experiments in Slurm can be found by looking at MeanTrainingReturns.py and the slurm_configs folder.
